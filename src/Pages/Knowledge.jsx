                        The average time for crediting funds to the Balance is 1â€“5 hours. If itâ€™s been more than 5 hours
                        since you transferred funds to the Balance, and the subscription has not been renewed, write to
                        the support chat, our employees will individually advise you on how to solve the problem.

                        Important!

                        Don't forget to take into account the fee of the exchange you use for the transaction. After
                        replenishing funds on the Balance, pay attention to the entered amount. Perhaps the amount
                        entered was less than the subscription cost due to the fee. For example, you replenished the
                        Balance for the exact amount of the package cost $79, and $78.60 was credited to the Balance
                        ($0.40 was withheld by the platform when transferring cryptocurrency). In this case, if your
                        payment methods do not have a bank card from which you can withdraw the remaining $0.40, the
                        withdrawal of funds from the Balance and the renewal of the subscription will not occur.

                        StreamPrisma service cannot be subject to any sanctions since you are simply streaming content
                        using the service.

                        Disconnecting from monetization depends on what content the user adds to start looped streams.
                        As a reminder, creating videos for broadcasts is subject to the rules of the platforms where you
                        plan to send the stream.

                        We strongly recommend that you follow the advice on the length of the video file for broadcast.
                        Do not use short videos for 5-10 minutes and loop them. It is better if the duration of the
                        content for the broadcast is at least 30 minutes, optimally - an hour and a half.

                        There was a case when a user was banned from monetization for repeating too short a video
                        segment in a looped stream.
                        You can read more about the reasons for disabling monetization and how to solve this problem in
                        Google.

                        Most often, the broadcast stops or is interrupted for 2 reasons:

                        The video file for the looped broadcast does not meet the platform requirements on which you
                        started the stream. We advise you to pay attention to video optimization. We wrote about
                        optimization in more detail above. Temporary disruptions on the platforms. We recommend you
                        double-check whether your video meets the platform requirements and whether the video file is
                        optimized. Try restarting the stream, and also check the broadcast settings and broadcast key
                        settings (whether the specified video file resolution and frame rate match the platform
                        settings). If, after all the checks, the problem with the broadcast has not been resolved - write
                        to the support chat, we will help you ðŸ™‚

                        The good news is that we have a simple option for those who want to switch from the StreamPrisma
                        service to launch live streams.

                        You need to choose a tariff with your provider that includes the largest number of additional
                        streams and independently launch live broadcasts with OBS, OneStream or any other software for
                        streaming to a large number of sites.

                        If necessary, we can give recommendations and provide guidance for the OBS settings.

                        We created Stream Scheduler to make streaming easier for our users.

                        Let's take a closer look at the main features:

                        The scheduling tool is designed to allow users to set up and manage their streams effortlessly.
                        You can plan your streams and configure them to start at specific times, making it easier to
                        maintain a consistent streaming schedule.
